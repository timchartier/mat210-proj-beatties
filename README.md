# mat210-proj-beatties

MAT210 Spring 2021 Final Project - Beatties Ford Road

Deployed to Heroku at https://beatties-ford-road.herokuapp.com.

Also at https://share.streamlit.io/wesmith4/mat210-proj-beatties/main/beatties.py.

## Notes for development

- In "sub-pages" in the `subpages/` directory, be sure to wrap all of your code in an `run()` function after importing necessary modules.
- If you need to import a new module, be sure to do `$ pipreqs --force` in your terminal (in the project directory) to update the `requirements.txt` file.
