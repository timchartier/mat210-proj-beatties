MAT210 Spring 2021 Final Project - Beatties Ford Road

Deployed to Heroku at https://beatties-ford-road.herokuapp.com.

## Notes for development
---
* In "sub-pages," be sure to wrap all of your code in an `app()` function after importing necessary modules.
* If you need to import a new module, be sure to do `$ pipreqs --force` in your terminal to update the `requirements.txt` file.
