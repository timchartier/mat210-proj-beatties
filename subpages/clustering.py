    In this project, we use an export from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Quality of Life Explorer (QOL) as our primary dataset for the mathematical analyses and visualizations in the dashboard. This online tool, available at https://mcmap.org/qol/, is an excellent asset on its own, enabling comparison of its large selection of variables over the map of Mecklenburg County. The QOL Explorer divides Mecklenburg County into NPAs, or Neighborhood Profile Areas, for its spatial visualization of the included variables. As defined on the Explorerâ€™s site:
    > *Neighborhood Profile Areas (NPAs) are geographic areas used for the organization and presentation of data in the Quality of Life Study.
    The boundaries were developed with community input and are based on one or more Census block groups.* (QOL)

    In our use of this data, we narrow the scope to the Neighborhood Profile Areas surrounding Beatties Ford Road, which we separate into "clusters" based on a mathematical method known as [*k-means clustering*](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-k-means-clustering-in-machine-learning-6a6e67336aa1), using curated sets of characteristics or characteristics of your choosing. Interpreting the clusters as presented in the map and data frame below, we assert that NPAs in the **same cluster** share **similar characteristics**, while NPAs in **different clusters** have **dissimilar characteristics**.

    Try clustering the NPAs according to the presets available in the dropdown list, but also experiment with your own selection of variables! Observing how certain clusterings are similar or different can provide exceptional insight into correlations between demographic, economic, educational, and many other kinds of factors.

                    When we construct 2 clusters of these NPAs, we observe quite a clean geographic break between a northern section and a southern section of the area along Beatties Ford Road, with large differences between these clusters' average racial composition. As we change this number to 3, 4, or 5 clusters, we identify smaller, more specific areas with even greater racial uniformity.

                    Additionally, try comparing the two-cluster map using these variables with the two-cluster map using the variables for "Household Income 2017" and "Home Sales Price 2015." The similarity is quite striking.

                    When we use two clusters, we see a north-south split similar to that observed in the clustering according to racial composition. When observing how the NPAs are separated into 5 clusters, we notice that the `Household_Income_2018` variable quite obviously declines in progression from north to south along the road.

                    You will notice in various clusterings that the pair of NPAs 421 and 447 consistently appear in the most privileged clusters.

For example, notice that the construction of two clusters based on educational variables appears nearly the same as the two clusters based on racial composition, where the cluster with averages indicating lower academic proficiency or success correlates with the cluster with a higher average percentage of black residents.

                    Interestingly, increasing the number of clusters here (try 4 or 5) reveals that a hypothetical "academic index" based on the cluster averages for these variables would clearly decrease from north to south along the road.

                    We should note that the Early Care Proximity variable in this set shows the highest values in the cluster(s) closer to downtown Charlotte. This likely is due to the proximity to an urban area in addition to other demographic factors.

                    Regarding spatial and aesthetic variables, we can observe that clusters near the downtown area have much greater density of housing units in their land area than do the clusters farther north along the road, and in general these housing units are smaller. This is consistent with expectations for urban density compared with surrounding suburbs and more rural areas.

                    We also find that residents in the NPAs in the clusters closer to Huntersville own their homes at a greater rate relative to other clusters, and these homes are more valuable (as measured by average Home Sales Price).

Regardless of the number of clusters used here, there is a large cluster of NPAs in the northern section that has significant lower average crime rates than the rest of the clusters. 

                    Interestingly, we observe that the NPAs right at the end of Beatties Ford road, around Johnson C. Smith University show lower rates of crime than those just to the north, which goes against the mentioned assumption. When creating 5 clusters for these variables, we can see that the two clusters with the highest property and violent crime rates are single NPAs â€“ 70 and 374 â€“ which include West Charlotte High School and Lincoln Heights Neighborhood Park, respectively.
